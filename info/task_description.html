<p>
    You are captain of a ship and you need to deliver cargo through
    ice rocks, icebergs and wandering tornadoes.
    You need to deliver the cargo as quick as possible and save fuel.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a map of ice sea as a square grid and quantity of fuel. You start at north-west corner and you should
    deliver the cargo at south-east corner. The sea is full by rocks and wandering magnetic tornados.
    Tornadoes are small but dangerous. They randomly wanders at sea, but when you ship is near, they
    start "chase" by your ship. Tornadoes trying to use the shortest path, but can not pass through rocks.
    You should not meet with a tornado, do not struck in rocks and don't leave the map.
</p>

<p>
    The map is represented as a sequence of strings. Where "S" is your ship, "." is an empty cell,
    "X" is rock and "O" is a tornado. For each step you should return an action as a string with one character.
    Actions: "N" is move to North, "S" - South, "W" - West,
    "E" - East and "." is wait. Tornadoes and the ship move simultaneous, but don't try to move forward at tornadoes.
</p>

<p>
    You have 100 units of fuel and each move takes one (even wait). You should economize fuel, because you points
    depends on how much fuel is remaining in each game. If fuel doesn't remained, then this is game over.

</p>

<p>
    You will play at this game until game over. For each game you will receive points equal of remaining fuel.
    If you crashed, then 0 points for the current game. The result score is sum of scores for games.
    Each game start in a new environment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A sea map as a tuple of strings and remaining fuel as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The action as a string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you will examine how to use pathfinding algorithms in changing enviroments.
    And it can be useful for network routing with unstable topology.
